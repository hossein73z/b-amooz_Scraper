# b-amooz_Scraper
A python script to download data about german words from "https://dic.b-amooz.com/" and write them into a tsv file for the "Flashcards Deluxe" learning mobile app.

- Export deck by text.
- Put the exported file in the same folder as 'b-amooz_Scraper'.
- Install requirements.
- Run `main.py`.
- When asked, first write the name of the exported file, then the row number of the first german word.
- Let the program do its thing.
- If there is any typo, the program will ask you to correct them.

- Rename `output.txt` to your original file name.
- Import new file back to the app.
